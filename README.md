# A heavily modified fork of Asraye's revolt.js template https://github.com/Asraye/BasicRevoltBotTemplate

This is a template I made if you wanna make a Last.FM bot yourself. It already has basic Last.FM commands like:
- Now Playing
- Top Artists
- Top Tracks
- Recent Tracks
- User Info

# Huge thanks to Asraye for helping me out on this bot template :D Go check him out on these Socials:

# Configuration

replace `API_KEY` on `config.json` with your last.fm api key
and then you'd have to put your bot token on `config.json`

# Setup
Type this in the terminal:
> npm install revolt.js
> npm install node-fetch@2

# Running it:
>node index.js

## Screenshots of it working here:
